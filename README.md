mysqli_test_class
=================

A little script I wrote in PHP to test or execute queries in mysql

All this does so far is to do one query, or an array of queries, 
Or, test queries using mysql transactions. 
Started building it with the idea that it could be modified to be
the basis for migrations, but it's not quite there yet.
